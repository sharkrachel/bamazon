# bamazon
An Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and Node

## What does it do?
There are two programs. bamazonCustomer.js is a product purchasing program that displays items in stock and prompts the user to make a purchase. If there is enough of the item in stock, the purchase will go through and the stock quantity will update.  bamazonManager.js is a stock management program that allows users to view products for sale, items low in inventory. It also allows users to add to the inventory and add new products.

## How was it made?
These two programs were made using MySQL database, Node.js and JavaScript.

Below are deomonstrations of the two different programs.
